This can be applied with the `/role-set` command. By default, no roles are set, users are free to use both music and playlist commands.\n\n**`Bot behaviour`**:\nThe bot disconnects from a voice channel if no users are left in it as soon as the last user leaves to prevent unused guild data from piling up and welcomes any user that joins its current channel.\n\n**`Moderation commands`**:\nCommands that can be used to manage/moderate a Discord guild, some of them include basic moderation commands such as `/purge`, `/ban`, `/kick`, `/vckick`, `/vcmove` and commands for managing channels, such as `/make-text-channel`, `/make-voice-channel` etc.\n\n> How do I use command X?\nUse /help **{command}** to see its help entry.\n\n> What to do in case of corrupted role/playlist structure? ('_Failed to read..._' error)\nUse the `/role-reset` or `/playlist-delete-all rewrite:True` command.\n\n> Why no **/volume**?\nTo prevent disputes over volume, each user manages their own volume output from the bot using Discord's '_user volume_' slider.",
