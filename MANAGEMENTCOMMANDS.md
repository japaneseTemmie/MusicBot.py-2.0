Here are hidden commands that can only be executed by the owner of the bot through classic prefix-based commands (prefix + name).
It is recommended to run these in a _private_ channel.

Substitute **(command_prefix)** with the bot's command prefix. (default is **?**)

- (command_prefix)**reload-cogs**
   Reloads all cogs. Useful for applying code changes without restarting the whole program.
   Note: All voice clients are automatically disconnected and cleaned up for safety reasons.
